  ## About the project📜
Also exploring the frontend world, here I made a digital clock that shows the current time through the 'Date' class.

## Technologies used 💻⚙️

## Project example

<p align = "center"> 
  <img alt = "Clock image" src = "assets/digitalwatch1_800x400.png" />

 ```bash
I confess.. it's pretty cool to be playing with the CSS
```
<p align = "center"> 
  <img alt = "Clock image" src = "assets/digitalwatch2_800x400.png" />
</p>
